During my exchange program in 2024, I had the privilege of taking the class as part of the Red team, under the guidance of lab instructors Dr Danny Braunstein and Dr Dave Barrett. I served as the Information Officer for the team where I managed the shared Google Drive and Fusion repository, ensuring that all files were well organized.

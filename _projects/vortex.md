# The legendary class: 2.009
2.009 is one of MIT's most famous classes. Teams of 15 to 20 seniors are tasked with creating a fully functional product prototype and present the product to a live audience of over 300 people in just **13 weeks**. The class is structured to take students through the product design process, from problem statement and concept ideation through to a final prototype. During the process, the concept is refined and taken through concept, architecture, and technical reviews. Lab instructors and course staff give teams regular feedback to shape the projects in a constructive manner.

# Sound the alarm! Red! Red! Red

During my exchange program in 2024, I had the privilege of taking the class as part of the Red team, under the guidance of lab instructors Dr Danny Braunstein and Dr Dave Barrett. 

# Responsibilities
## Information Officer
I served as the Information Officer for the Red team where I managed the shared Google Drive and Fusion repository, ensuring that all files were well organized.

## 3D Printing
The Pappalardo Lab was outfitted with a Bambu A1 printer for each team, along with several "backup" printers. To aleviate the issue of 17 people wanting to access a single printer, a sub-team was created through whom all 3D printing would be done. I volunteered to be on this team of four, and subsequently printed a majority of the parts used throughout the semester.

I gained valuable experience in selecting optimal printing orientations and parameters, as well as planning and liasing with other team members to best utilize the available time.
